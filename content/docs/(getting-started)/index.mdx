<h3> Sharpen your tools. Hone your instincts. Claim your bounties. </h3>

This is where raw skill meets engineered precision — a battle-tested toolkit forged in real bug bounty trenches. No fluff. No filler. Just lethal efficiency distilled into commands, workflows, and trade secrets that separate hunters from script kiddies.

<h2> Warning : </h2>
<h4>Extended use of Penquin may result in: </h4>

• Faster triage - Your notes app will miss you <br />
• More $$$ in your wallet - Your bank will ask uncomfortable questions <br />
• Increased productivity - Your Netflix queue will grow neglected <br />
• Unreasonable confidence - You'll start eyeballing Fortune 500 assets <br />
• Tool dependency - "How did I ever hack without this?" syndrome <br />


<h2> Contraindications: </h2>

<h4>Do not use Penquin if you:</h4>

• Prefer doing things the hard way.<br />
• Are allergic to efficient hacking.<br />
• Enjoy manual recon.<br />


<h2> Disclaimer: </h2>

<h4>We are not responsible for any: </h4>

• Increased bug bounty earnings <br />
• Expanded attack surface awareness <br />
• Career advancement in cybersecurity <br />


<h2> Why This Hits Different: </h2>

• Pre-built commands that slice through recon like a hot knife through butter. Why type when you can hunt? <br />
• Optimized attack chains that turn chaotic probing into a surgical strike. Less noise, more exploits. <br />
• A handpicked arsenal of techniques, tricks, and gotchas — crowdsourced from elite hunters and polished to a razor's edge.<br />


<h2> Architects of Chaos: </h2>

• [Sibhi](https://xibhi.github.io) – The reason Penquin doesn't just exist — it dominates.<br />
• [Krish](https://crish.vercel.app) – The code alchemist. Turns caffeine into clean execution and "it should work" into "it fucking works." <br />

This isn't some corporate-approved "security solution" built by a faceless team. It's a weaponized workflow forged by two hunters who got tired of doing things the hard way. No committees. No fluff. Just raw, iterative hacking — refined in the fires of real bug bounty battles.
