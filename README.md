# 🐧 Penquin

> Sharpen your tools. Hone your instincts. Claim your bounties.

This is where raw skill meets engineered precision — a battle-tested toolkit forged in real bug bounty trenches. No fluff. No filler. Just lethal efficiency distilled into commands, workflows, and trade secrets that separate hunters from script kiddies.

---

# 🔥 Why This Hits Different:
- Pre-built commands that slice through recon like a hot knife through butter. Why type when you can hunt?
- Optimized attack chains that turn chaotic probing into a surgical strike. Less noise, more exploits.
- A handpicked arsenal of techniques, tricks, and gotchas — crowdsourced from elite hunters and polished to a razor's edge.

# 👑 Architects of Chaos:
- **Sibhi** – The reason Penquin doesn't just exist — it dominates.
- **Krish** – The code alchemist. Turns caffeine into clean execution and "it should work" into "it fucking works."

This isn't some corporate-approved "security solution" built by a faceless team. It's a weaponized workflow forged by two hunters who got tired of doing things the hard way. No committees. No fluff. Just raw, iterative hacking — refined in the fires of real bug bounty battles.
